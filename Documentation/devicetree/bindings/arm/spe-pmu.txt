* ARMv8.2 Statistical Profiling Extension (SPE) Performance Monitor Units (PMU)

ARMv8.2 introduces the optional Statistical Profiling Extension for collecting
performance sample data using an in-memory trace buffer.

** SPE Required properties:

- compatible : should be one of:
	       "arm,statistical-profiling-extension-v1"

- interrupts : Exactly 1 PPI must be listed. For heterogeneous systems where
               SPE is only supported on a subset of the CPUs, a PPI partition
	       described in the arm,gic-v3 binding must be used to describe
	       the set of CPUs this interrupt is affine to.

** Example:

spe-pmu {
        compatible = "arm,statistical-profiling-extension-v1";
        interrupts = <GIC_PPI 05 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH &part1>;
};
